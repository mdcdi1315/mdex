## Mod-provided feature placement modifier types.

This series of documentation defines placement modifiers for placed features,
in order to simplify some common tasks that you might be doing during datapack developing.

For additional information over what are the placement modifiers, you can see [this article](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Placed_feature).

Although that themselves are modded types and do adopt the DCO logic, none 
of the below types do currently use it. 
Defining and using DCO features will be useless on these types.

> [!NOTE]
These types described here existed and in older versions of the mod, but they were not yet production-ready in that time.
You should consider as that these types were first defined in 1.5.0 version of the mod.
