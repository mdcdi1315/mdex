## Is valid ceiling placement modifier.

This modifier takes the input block position and determines 
whether the input position is a position that is just below of the ceiling 
of a cave.

If the passed position is not such, no positions are returned.

This is useful for features that generate decoration on cave ceilings.

This placement modifier does not have additional fields; it is just defined.

The name for referencing this placement modifier is `mdex:ensure_valid_ceiling_placement`.
