## Is valid ceiling placement modifier.

This modifier takes the input block position and determines 
whether the input position is a position that is just above of the surface
of a cave, or the surface of a terrain in general.

If the passed position is not such, no positions are returned.

This is useful for features that generate decoration on cave surfaces.

This placement modifier does not have additional fields; it is just defined.

The name for referencing this placement modifier is `mdex:ensure_valid_surface_placement`.
