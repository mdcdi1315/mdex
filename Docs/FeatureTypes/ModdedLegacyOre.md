### Modded Legacy Ore Feature Type

This feature type uses the 'legacy (i.e. Minecraft's)' code to generate the feature.

This is equivalently the same as `minecraft:ore` but being modded for modding cases.

It is recommended, to the extent where possible, to use instead the `mdex:modded_ore` 
feature type because it is much more performant than this one.

This feature type can be referenced with the resource location `mdex:modded_legacy_ore`.
