### Modded Ore Feature Type

This feature type defines small, modded ore feature configurations that can be applied.

It uses a much more optimized variant of the original implementation, intended only for a small number of ore blocks.

Note that the 'size' field now defines the number of ore blocks at least to place at the specified area.

Placement mode changes if the size becomes more than 8.

Rest of the config has remained untouched.

This feature type can be referenced with the resource location `mdex:modded_ore`.

More information about ore configurations can be found [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ore_(feature)).
