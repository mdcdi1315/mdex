## The Modded Spring feature type.

> [!WARNING]
This feature type was first defined in 1.5.0 version of the mod.
If attempted to be used on older mod versions, Minecraft will 
justifiably complain that it cannot find the requested feature type.

This feature type provides the Minecraft's 
spring feature, but being used for modding cases.

It has the same usage and syntax as the ordinary one. 
You can see [this article](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Spring) for how the feature type can be configured.

Note that the feature type name is `mdex:modded_spring`.

Additionally, the config does provide the `modids` field for conditionally loading 
such a feature only when specific mods are loaded.
