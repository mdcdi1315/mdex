## Datapack developing with Mining Dimension: EX mod

In order to ease developing with the Minecraft's datapack features, plus including performance optimizations,
the mod defines and/or modifies some aspects of the game itself.

These alternatives are recommended due to the performance optimizations that most of them include.

This is *not* a document describing how Minecraft's datapacks do work;
For more information however, you can visit [this wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) instead.
