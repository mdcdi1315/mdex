## Datapack developing with Mining Dimension: EX mod

In order to ease developing with the Minecraft's datapack features, plus including performance optimizations,
the mod defines and/or modifies some aspects of the game itself.

These alternatives are recommended due to the performance optimizations that most of them include.

> [!CAUTION]
These documents are *not* describing how Minecraft's datapacks do work;
For more information however, you can visit [this wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) instead.

> [!WARNING]
The JSON examples provided in some topics may not work for all Minecraft versions that the mod is provided for.
This happens due to the fact that Minecraft's implementation details are changed frequently.
