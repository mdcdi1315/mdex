### Mod-provided structure processors

Structure processors in Minecraft are intercepting objects during a large structure generation and modify it in a way denoted by them.

Different structure processors are already existing by Minecraft itself, but this mod provides and some additional for making 
structure placement and generation a less painful process when creating Mining Dimension datapacks.

The structure processors are only used by the Jigsaw structure types (`minecraft:jigsaw` structure type).

A list describing the Minecraft-provided processors is found in [this article](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Processor_list#Processors).

This is also a list presenting the mod-provided structure processors.
