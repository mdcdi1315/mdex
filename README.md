## Welcome to the documentation branch of the Mining Dimension: EX mod!!!

This branch aims to provide the backbone and the doc changes 
as the mod is developed.

It was created as a seperate branch so that any changes related to these remain here and do not propagate to the code repository.

Technical documentation about the datapack features that it provides can be found [here](./Docs/Index.md).

An overview of how creating a data pack for the mod is roughly described [here](./Docs/GeneralDevelopment/Index.md).

A good and prime example is also to see the [Default MD Experience Pack](https://github.com/mdcdi1315/mdex_default_experience_pack) code as an additional learning source for how things are done.
