## Mining Dimension: EX

This is another [Minecraft: Java Edition](https://minecraft.net/en-us) mining dimension mod that is based on Max Henkel's
[Advanced Mining Dimension](https://github.com/henkelmax/advanced-mining-dimension) mod 
but taking that and multiplying its possibilities to 1000 and more.

Except than adding the dimension itself and the portal that is the gateway for the player to move between the dimensions,
it adds a lot of stuff to the game such as:

- Modded feature types that allow from data to define features to run when specific mods are loaded.
- Extra feature types to use from data directly
- Customizable monster room features
- The 'Loot Table Appender' structure processor for appending directly a loot table to a container block in a structure
- Many new blocks to further enhance your builds
- Perf enhancements to world gen due to the aforementioned features
- Copper tools for your first adventures in the dimension
