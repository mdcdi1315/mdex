 * Defines the base interface for classes that do implement per-dimension saved data logic. <br /> <br />

 * By default, during a construction of an object implementing this interface, the internal data representation must be filled in that
 * way so that it is like saved data for it never existed (thus, it is like you never saved your Minecraft world). <br />
 * Any saved data, if any, will be provided later through the invocation of the {@link ISavedData#LoadFrom(SavedDataCommonHeader)} method. <br />
 * Additionally, both the load and save methods should throw on any exception. Error handling will be done by the attaching wrapper host class.
 * @since 1.7.0
